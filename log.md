# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tuesday 29th May 2018

**Today's Progress**: I contributed to an open source project for the first time on GitHub!

**Thoughts** Even though I have worked through HTML, CSS and some JavaScript tutorials, I was unsure about how to take part in open source projects - something that I have to learn in order to work with other programmers. I used a great tutorial by Syknapse on GitHub to (1) fork and clone a repository onto my desktop; (2) make my own branch; (3) edit my branch with my own code; (4) save it as a commit; (5) push my branch back onto GitHub; (6) Submitting a pull request.

### Day 2: Thursday 31st May 2018

**Today's Progress**: Using HTML and Javascript, I created an interactive questionnaire to determine whether you need antihypertensive medication based on you blood pressure, and if so, what type, based on your age.

**Thoughts** It was enjoyable getting closer and closer to the final product. The main challenges were triggering the first round of pop-up questions with a button and triggering the second round of pop-up questions based on the answer to the first question. The solution to the second challenge what fully defining the first question before diving into the second question.
