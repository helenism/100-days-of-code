# 100 Days Of Code - Helen's Log

### Day 15: Friday 6th July 2018

**Today's Progress**: Deploying my 805 Restaurant Menu webpage!

**Thoughts**: I am happy with how far this project has gone! [My webpage](https://helenism.github.io/project-805-restaurants/) looks indistinguishable to the [official 805 Restaurant website](http://805restaurants.com/home.php). This isn't a clone (no menu page exists on their website), but my menu page looks like it came right from there! :D

I've used HTML, flexbox and grid in my CSS, JavaScript (JQuery), font awesome, Google fonts and *a lot* of mental energy to build this. There's still much more I can do, like implementing Bootstrap scrollspy. I think that'll make it more sophisicated~

### Day 14: Thursday 5th July 2018

**Today's Progress**: Using Python to code a number guessing game!
**Thoughts**: This is my first Python project! I can actually use code to communicate with people!

### Day 13: Wednesday 4th July 2018

**Today's Progress**: Flexgrid saves the day! - Fixing my footer

**Thoughts**: I learned how to use flexbox CSS to fix the columns and appearance of my restaurant menu footer. I also used font awesome!

### Day 12: Tuesday 3rd July 2018

**Today's Progress**: Using bootstrap for a restaurant page

**Thoughts**: I was a bit fed up with my layout not being how I wanted it, so I used bootstrap.

### Day 12: Monday 25th June 2018

**Today's Progress**: Using JQuery to toggle a paragraph.

**Thoughts**: I used JQuery by building a button switch that makes a paragraph of text appear and disappear. I quite like how JQuery is so readable and simplified compared to "vanilla JavaScript."

### Day 11: Sunday 24th June 2018

**Today's Progress**: My favourite Nigerian resraurant doesn't have a menu webpage! üò± So I decided to start building it myself. ü§§

**Thoughts**: Restaurant websites is one of those core finished projects one should have on their portfolio and I absolutely love this restaurant in London called 805 Restaurants. I'm going to implement some sample mouth-watering photos and JavaScript to make the webpage nicer to interact with.

### Day 10: Wednesday 20th June 2018

**Today's Progress**: I am working on my personal website from scratch!‚ú®

**Thoughts**: Most of the work has been on the CSS. Media query, floats, transparent elements and more... For now, I just have a home and contact page, but all the links in the navigation bar are functional. I'm going to work on getting the positions of certain div sections where I want them to be and add more content to the pages. Soon, I'll link the updated site up to my server, so stay tuned!

### Day 9: Tuesday 19th June 2018

**Today's Progress**: I made an informative HTML webpage (spiced with some CSS of course) at my first (free) coding bootcamp class with CodeFirst:Girls.

**Thoughts**: It was lovely to work alongside other people who code. I look forward to our group projects, where I'll learn how to program as a team.

### Day 8: Monday 11th June 2018

**Today's Progress**: I improved my tribute page on Kapustin **a lot**, fixing the issue with the images being static. They now resize as the viewport width changes. Horray!

**Thoughts**: I threw in some border-radius CSS to make the images and blockquote look more interesting to look at. Curved edges are fancy. I managed to center the timeline by adding <code>margin: auto</code> to <code>ul</code> in the CSS, even though I had <code>text-align: center</code> to keep the dates aligned.

### Day 7: Sunday 10th June 2018

**Today's Progress**: I created a [tribute page](https://github.com/helenism/tribute-pages) for my favourite jazz composer, Nikolai Kapustin. I made a HTML and an external CSS file.

**Thoughts**: Aside from some more imaginative CSS, the part I need to work on is making the pictures resize as the browser's size changes. At the moment, the two photos are responsive but have static dimensions.

### Day 6: Tuesday 5th June 2018

**Today's Progress**: I played around with JavaScript functions in Atom as I followed my fave [JavaScript YouTube video tutorial by Derek Banas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fju9ii8YsGs&t=966s). I also learned how to manipulate arrays some more.

**Thoughts**: I also learned what += does. X += Y means X = X + Y so X keeps changing each time the function is cycled through. Oh, how I love maths.
<hr>

### Day 5: Sunday 3rd June 2018

**Today's Progress**: I created a webpage on which each time the customer clicks a button to enter the price of a purchase, it is added to a list. When the customer clicks the second button, the total price and the 20% tip are calculated and shown. 

**Thoughts**: Arrays were a bit of a new concept for me, so it was great to actually use them to understand how they work. I learned some new array properties too. At first I thought of creating a form for the customer to enter the prices, but quickly realised an array would be better. Using a JavaScript-controlled button, the customer can keep adding prices to an array, which I can work with.

### Day 4: Saturday 2nd June 2018

**Today's Progress**: I converted strings in an array into a list using JavaScript. 

**Thoughts**: This helped me to practice using loops in a real life situation and dealing with tag id's. The code can be found in [Helenism Doodles](https://github.com/helenism/helenism-doodles).

### Day 3: Friday 1st June 2018

**Today's Progress**: I made a new repository where I will collect all my little doodle experiments on GitHub. 

**Thoughts**: These are some blocks of code that are too small to have their own repositories, but have very specific purposes which I can refer to in the future when I am coding for bigger projects. The first doodle is a button that converts the temperature in fahrenheit to celsius. I'm getting more and more used to playing around with GitHub ‚ú®

### Day 2: Thursday 31st May 2018

**Today's Progress**: Using HTML and Javascript, I created an interactive questionnaire to determine whether you need antihypertensive medication based on you blood pressure, and if so, what type, based on your age.

**Thoughts**: It was enjoyable getting closer and closer to the final product. The main challenges were triggering the first round of pop-up questions with a button and triggering the second round of pop-up questions based on the answer to the first question. The solution to the second challenge what fully defining the first question before diving into the second question.

### Day 1: Tuesday 29th May 2018

**Today's Progress**: I contributed to an open source project for the first time on GitHub!

**Thoughts**: Even though I have worked through HTML, CSS and some JavaScript tutorials, I was unsure about how to take part in open source projects - something that I have to learn in order to work with other programmers. I used a great tutorial by Syknapse on GitHub to (1) fork and clone a repository onto my desktop; (2) make my own branch; (3) edit my branch with my own code; (4) save it as a commit; (5) push my branch back onto GitHub; (6) Submitting a pull request.
