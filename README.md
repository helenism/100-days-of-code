# 100 Days Of Code - Helen's Log

### Day 1: Tuesday 29th May 2018

**Today's Progress**: I contributed to an open source project for the first time on GitHub!

**Thoughts**: Even though I have worked through HTML, CSS and some JavaScript tutorials, I was unsure about how to take part in open source projects - something that I have to learn in order to work with other programmers. I used a great tutorial by Syknapse on GitHub to (1) fork and clone a repository onto my desktop; (2) make my own branch; (3) edit my branch with my own code; (4) save it as a commit; (5) push my branch back onto GitHub; (6) Submitting a pull request.

### Day 2: Thursday 31st May 2018

**Today's Progress**: Using HTML and Javascript, I created an interactive questionnaire to determine whether you need antihypertensive medication based on you blood pressure, and if so, what type, based on your age.

**Thoughts**: It was enjoyable getting closer and closer to the final product. The main challenges were triggering the first round of pop-up questions with a button and triggering the second round of pop-up questions based on the answer to the first question. The solution to the second challenge what fully defining the first question before diving into the second question.

### Day 3: Friday 1st June 2018

**Today's Progress**: I made a new repository where I will collect all my little doodle experiments on GitHub. 

**Thoughts**: These are some blocks of code that are too small to have their own repositories, but have very specific purposes which I can refer to in the future when I am coding for bigger projects. The first doodle is a button that converts the temperature in fahrenheit to celsius. I'm getting more and more used to playing around with GitHub âœ¨

### Day 4: Saturday 2nd June 2018

**Today's Progress**: I converted strings in an array into a list using JavaScript. 

**Thoughts**: This helped me to practice using loops in a real life situation and dealing with tag id's. The code can be found in [Helenism Doodles](https://github.com/helenism/helenism-doodles).

### Day 5: Sunday 3rd June 2018

**Today's Progress**: I created a webpage on which each time the customer clicks a button to enter the price of a purchase, it is added to a list. When the customer clicks the second button, the total price and the 20% tip are calculated and shown. 

**Thoughts**: Arrays were a bit of a new concept for me, so it was great to actually use them to understand how they work. I learned some new array properties too. At first I thought of creating a form for the customer to enter the prices, but quickly realised an array would be better. Using a JavaScript-controlled button, the customer can keep adding prices to an array, which I can work with.
